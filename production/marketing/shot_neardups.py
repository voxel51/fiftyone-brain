"""
Script to generate a screenshot of near-duplicates using the uniqueness and
ranking.

You need to run this inside of an interactive shell like IPython because the
system will launch the dashboard and we need to have that process independent
of the python code.

Outputs are placed in the `outputs/` directory.

Usage::

    # From inside IPython
    run shot_neardups.py
