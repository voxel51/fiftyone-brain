# FiftyOne Brain: Production/Marketing

Tools for generating marketing material across the FiftyOne project.

This provides information on generating repeatable marketing material (graphs,
screenshots, etc) backed by code.

This is in `fiftyone-brain` instead of `fiftyone` because it may reference
experiment details with proprietary information that only exists in the brain.
