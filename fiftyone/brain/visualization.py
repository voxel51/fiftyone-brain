            to a reasonable number (e.g. 50) before running t-SNE, as this will
            suppress some noise and speed up the computation of pairwise

        perplexity (30.0): the perplexity to use. Perplexity is related to the
            number of nearest neighbors that is used in other manifold learning
            algorithms. Larger datasets usually require a larger perplexity.
            Typical values are in ``[5, 50]``
        learning_rate (200.0): the learning rate to use. Typical values are
            in ``[10, 1000]``. If the learning rate is too high, the data may
            look like a ball with any point approximately equidistant from its

            may look compressed in a dense cloud with few outliers. If the cost
