    in ``label_field`` based on the predcted labels in ``pred_field``.

    Mistakenness is measured based on either the ``confidence`` or ``logits``
    of the predictions in ``pred_field``. This measure can be used to detect
    things like annotation errors and unusually hard samples.

    For classifications, a ``mistakenness_field`` field is populated on each
    sample that quantifies the likelihood that the label in the ``label_field``
    of that sample is incorrect.

    For objects (detections, polylines, keypoints, etc), the mistakenness of
    each object in ``label_field`` is computed, using
    :meth:`fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.evaluate_detections` to
    locate corresponding objects in ``pred_field``. Three types of mistakes
    are identified:

    -   **(Mistakes)** Objects in ``label_field`` with a match in
        ``pred_field`` are assigned a mistakenness value in their
        ``mistakenness_field`` that captures the likelihood that the class
        label of the object in ``label_field`` is a mistake. A
        ``mistakenness_field + "_loc"`` field is also populated that captures
        the likelihood that the object in ``label_field`` is a mistake due
        to its localization (bounding box).

    -   **(Missing)** Objects in ``pred_field`` with no matches in
        ``label_field`` but which are likely to be correct will have their
        ``missing_field`` attribute set to True. In addition, if
        ``copy_missing`` is True, copies of these objects are *added* to the
        ground truth ``label_field``.

    -   **(Spurious)** Objects in ``label_field`` with no matches in
        ``pred_field`` but which are likely to be incorrect will have their
        ``spurious_field`` attribute set to True.

    In addition, for objects, the following sample-level fields are populated:

    -   **(Mistakes)** The ``mistakenness_field`` of each sample is populated
        with the maximum mistakenness of the objects in ``label_field``

    -   **(Missing)** The ``missing_field`` of each sample is populated with
        the number of missing objects that were deemed missing from
        ``label_field``.

    -   **(Spurious)** The ``spurious_field`` of each sample is populated with
        the number of objects in ``label_field`` that were given deemed
        spurious.
