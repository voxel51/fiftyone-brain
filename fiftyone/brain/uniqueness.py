    # embedded into a vector space based on the model.  Then, we compute the

    # then proportional to these distances.  The intuition is that a sample is
    # unique when it is far from other samples in the set.  This is different
    # than, say, "representativeness" which would stress samples that are core
    # to dense clusters of related samples.
